**yet another icon font**

Of course you have lots of fonts! but do you have a monolinear icon font whose weight matches the text of Proxima Nova™® - Regular?!?! *PROBABLY NOT! (unless you're mark simonson, in which case, mea culpa...)

## what's it look like, though?!?!?!?!?!

## nerdily

the glyphs inhabit the PUA, starting with F300, feel free to add glyphs thereabouts!

generate with robofont, or the [afdko](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (or also, the [afdko on github](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko)).

license: sil open font license. Basically the font is provided with no warranty whatsoever, but if you would like to fork it, you must find another name for it. sorrrry. but enjoy!
